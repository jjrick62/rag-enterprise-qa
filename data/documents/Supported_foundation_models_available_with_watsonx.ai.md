Instruction tuning information : The Granite family of models is trained on enterprise-relevant data sets from five domains: internet, academic, code, legal, and finance. Data used to train the models first undergoes IBM data governance reviews and is filtered of text that is flagged for hate, abuse, or profanity by the IBM-developed HAP filter. IBM shares information about the training methods and data sets used.

Data used during training : This model was trained on over 80 programming languages from GitHub. A filter was applied to exclude from the training data any licensed code or code that is marked with opt-out requests. Nevertheless, the model's output might include code from its training data that requires attribution. The model was not instruction-tuned. Submitting input with only an instruction and no examples might result in poor model output.
