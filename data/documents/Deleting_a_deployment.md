 Deleting a deployment 

Delete your deployment when you no longer need it to free up resources. You can delete a deployment from a deployment space, or programmatically, by using the Python client or Watson Machine Learning APIs.

 Deleting a deployment from a space 

To remove a deployment:



1.  Open the Deployments page of your deployment space.
2.  Choose Delete from the action menu for the deployment name.
