 Solving and analyzing a model: the diet problem 

This example shows you how to create and solve a Python-based model by using a sample.

 Procedure 

To create and solve a Python-based model by using a sample:



1.  Download and extract all the [DO-samples](https://github.com/IBMDecisionOptimization/DO-Samples) on to your computer. You can also download just the  diet.zip file from the  Model_Builder subfolder for your product and version, but in this case, do not extract it.
2.  Open your project or create an empty project.
3.  On the  Manage tab of your project, select the  Services and integrations section and click  Associate service. Then select an existing  Machine Learning service instance (or create a new one ) and click  Associate. When the service is associated, a success message is displayed, and you can then close the  Associate service window.
4.  Select the    Assets tab.
5.  Select   New asset > Solve optimization problems in the   Work with models section.
6.  Click  Local file in the   Solve optimization problems window that opens.
7.  Browse to find the  Model_Builder folder in your downloaded  DO-samples.  Select the relevant product and version subfolder. Choose the  Diet.zip file and click  Open. Alternatively use drag and drop.
8.  If you haven't already associated a  Machine Learning service with your project, you must first select  Add a  Machine Learning service to select or create one before you choose a deployment space for your  experiment.
9.  Click  New deployment space, enter a name, and click  Create (or select an existing space from the drop-down menu).
10. Click Create.A  Decision Optimization model is created with the same name as the sample.
11. In the   Prepare data view, you can see the data assets imported.These tables represent the min and max values for nutrients in the diet (diet_nutrients), the nutrients in different foods (diet_food_nutrients), and the price and quantity of specific foods (diet_food).

12. Click   Build model in the sidebar to view your model.The Python model minimizes the cost of the food in the diet while satisfying minimum nutrient and calorie requirements.

Note also how the inputs (tables in the  Prepare data view) and the outputs (in this case the solution table to be displayed in the Explore solution  view) are specified in this model.
13. Run the model by clicking the Run button in the   Build model view.
