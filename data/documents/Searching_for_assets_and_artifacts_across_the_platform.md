 Searching for assets 

To search for an asset, you can enter one or more words in the global search field. The search results are matches from these properties of assets:



*  Name
*  Description
*  Tags
*  Table name



You can customize your searches with these techniques:



*  [Searching for the start of a word](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/manage-data/search-assets.html?context=cdpaas&locale=enstart)
*  [Searching for a part of a word](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/manage-data/search-assets.html?context=cdpaas&locale=enpart)
*  [Searching for a phrase](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/manage-data/search-assets.html?context=cdpaas&locale=enphrase)
*  [Searching for multiple alternative words](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/manage-data/search-assets.html?context=cdpaas&locale=enmultiple)



 Searching for the start of a word 

To search for words starting with a letter or letters, enter the first 1-3 letters of the word. If you enter only one letter, words starting with that letter are returned. If you enter two or three letters, words starting with those letters will be prioritized over the words containing those letters. For example, if you search for i , you will get results like initial and infinite , but not definite. If you search for in you will additionally get results containing definite ranked lower in the results list.

 Searching for a part of a word 

To search for partial word matches, include more than 3 letters. For example, if you search for conn, you might get results like connection and disconnect.

Only the first 12 characters in a word are used in the search. Any search terms that you enter that are longer than 12 characters are truncated to the first 12 characters.

Searches for partial words don't work in the description fields.

 Searching for a phrase 

To search for a specific phrase, surround the phrase with double quotation marks. For example, if you search for "payment plan prediction", your results contain exactly that phrase.

You can include a quoted phrase within a longer search string. For example, if you search for credit card "payment plan prediction", you might get results that contain credit card, credit, card, and payment plan prediction.

When you search for a phrase in English, natural language analysis optimizes the search results in the following ways:



*  Words that are not important to the search intent are removed from the search query.
*  Phrases in the search string that are common in English are automatically ranked higher than results for individual words.



For example, if you search for find credit card interest in United States, you might get the following results:



*  Matches for credit card interest and United States are prioritized.
*  Matches for credit, card, interest, United, and States are returned.
*  Matches for in are not returned.



 Searching for multiple alternative words 

To find results that contain any of your search terms, enter multiple words. For example, if you search for machine learning, the results contain the word machine, the word learning, or both words.

 Selecting results 

To select the best result, look at which property of the asset or artifact matches your search string. The matching text is highlighted.

The highest scoring results are for matches to the name of the asset. Multiple assets can have the same name. However, the name of the project, deployment or space, is shown underneath the asset name so you can determine which result is the one you want.

Click an asset name to view it in its project or deployment space.

Results are prioritized in this order:



1.  Matches of quoted phrases or common phrases (for English only)
2.  Exact matches of complete words
3.  Partial matches of complete words
4.  Fuzzy matches



From the search results, you can click Preview to view more information in the side panel.

 Filtering and sorting results 

You can filter search results by these properties:



*  Type of asset
*  Tags
*  Owners (for some types of assets)
*  The user who modified the asset
*  The time period when the asset was last modified
*  Projects (assets only)
*  Workspaces
*  Schema
*  Table
*  Contains: Feature group



You can sort results by the most relevant or the last modified date.
