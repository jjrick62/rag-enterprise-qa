 Decision Optimization experiment views and scenarios 

The  Decision Optimization experiment UI has different  views in which you can select data, create models, solve different scenarios, and visualize the results.

Note: To create and run Optimization models, you must have both a  Machine Learning service added to your project and a deployment space that is associated with your  experiment:



1.  Add a [Machine Learning service](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/machine-learning) to your project. You can either add this service at the project level (see [Creating a  Watson Machine Learning Service instance](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/ml-service-instance.html)), or you can add it when you first create a new  Decision Optimization experiment: click  Add a  Machine Learning service, select, or create a  New service, click  Associate, then close the window.
2.  Associate a [deployment space](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/ml-runtime/spaces) with your  Decision Optimization experiment (see [Deployment spaces](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/ml-spaces_local.htmlcreate)). A deployment space can be created or selected when you first create a new  Decision Optimization experiment: click  Create a deployment space, enter a name for your deployment space, and click  Create. For existing models, you can also create, or select a space in the [Overview](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/DO/DODS_Introduction/modelbuilderUI.htmlModelBuilderInterface__section_overview) information pane.



When you add a Decision Optimization experiment as an asset in your project, you open the Decision Optimization experiment UI.

With the  Decision Optimization experiment UI, you can create and solve prescriptive optimization models that focus on the specific business problem that you want to solve.  To edit and solve models, you must have Admin or Editor roles in the project. Viewers of shared projects can only see  experiments, but cannot modify or run them.

You can create a  Decision Optimization model from scratch by entering a name or by choosing a .zip file, and then selecting  Create. Scenario 1 opens.

With the  Decision Optimization experiment UI, you can create several scenarios, with different data sets and optimization models. Thus, you, can create and compare different scenarios and see what impact changes can have on a problem.

For a step-by-step guide to build, solve and deploy a  Decision Optimization model, by using the user interface, see the [Quick start tutorial with video](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/getting-started/get-started-do.html).

For each of the following views, you can organize your screen as full-screen or as a split-screen. To do so, hover over one of the  view tabs ( Prepare data,  Build model,  Explore solution) for a second or two. A menu then appears where you can select  Full Screen,  Left or  Right. For example, if you choose  Left for the  Prepare data view, and then choose  Right for the  Explore solution view, you can see both these views on the same screen.
