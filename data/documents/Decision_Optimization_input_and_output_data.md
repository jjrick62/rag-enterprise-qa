 Input and output data 

You can access the input and output data you defined in the  experiment UI by using the following dictionaries.

The data that you imported in the Prepare data view in the  experiment UI is accessible from the input dictionary. You must define each table by using the syntax inputs['tablename']. For example, here food is an entity that is defined from the table called diet_food:

food = inputs['diet_food']

Similarly, to show tables in the  Explore solution  view of the  experiment UI you must specify them using the syntax outputs['tablename']. For example,

outputs['solution'] = solution_df

defines an output table that is called solution. The entity solution_df in the Python model defines this table.

You can find this Diet example in the  Model_Builder folder of the [DO-samples](https://github.com/IBMDecisionOptimization/DO-Samples). To import and run (solve) it in the  experiment UI, see [Solving and analyzing a model: the diet problem](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/DO/DODS_Notebooks/solveModel.htmltask_mtg_n3q_m1b).
