 Flow and SuperNode parameters 

You can define parameters for use in CLEM expressions and in scripting. They are, in effect, user-defined variables that are saved and persisted with the current flow or SuperNode and can be accessed from the user interface as well as through scripting.

If you save a flow, for example, any parameters you set for that flow are also saved. (This distinguishes them from local script variables, which can be used only in the script in which they are declared.) Parameters are often used in scripting to control the behavior of the script, by providing information about fields and values that don't need to be hard coded in the script.

You can set flow parameters in a flow script or in a flow's properties (right-click the canvas in your flow and select  Flow properties), and they're available to all nodes in the flow. They're displayed in the  Parameters list in the Expression Builder.

You can also set parameters for SuperNodes, in which case they're visible only to nodes encapsulated within that SuperNode.

Tip: For complete details about scripting, see the [Scripting and automation](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsd/nodes/scripting_guide/clementine/scripting_overview.html) guide.
