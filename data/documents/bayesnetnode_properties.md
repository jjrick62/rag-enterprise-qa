 bayesnetnode properties 

![Bayes Net node icon](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsd/nodes/scripting_guide/clementine/images/bayesian_network_icon.png)With the Bayesian Network (Bayes Net) node, you can build a probability model by combining observed and recorded evidence with real-world knowledge to establish the likelihood of occurrences. The node focuses on Tree Augmented NaÃ¯ve Bayes (TAN) and Markov Blanket networks that are primarily used for classification.

 inputs                              [field1 ... fieldN]         Bayesian network models use a single target field, and one or more input fields. Continuous fields are automatically binned.
