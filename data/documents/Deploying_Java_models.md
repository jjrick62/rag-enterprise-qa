 Deploying  Java models for  Decision Optimization 

You can deploy  Decision Optimization Java models in  Watson Machine Learning by using the  Watson Machine Learning REST API.

With the  Java worker API, you can create optimization models with OPL, CPLEX, and CP Optimizer Java APIs. Therefore, you can easily create your models locally, package them and deploy them on Watson Machine Learning by using the boilerplate that is provided in the public [Java worker GitHub](https://github.com/IBMDecisionOptimization/cplex-java-worker/blob/master/README.md).

The  Decision Optimization[Java worker GitHub](https://github.com/IBMDecisionOptimization/cplex-java-worker/blob/master/README.md) contains a boilerplate with everything that you need to run, deploy, and verify your Java models in  Watson Machine Learning, including an example. You can use the code in this repository to package your  Decision Optimization Java model in a .jar file that can be used as a  Watson Machine Learning model. For more information about  Java worker parameters, see the [Java documentation](https://github.com/IBMDecisionOptimization/do-maven-repo/blob/master/com/ibm/analytics/optim/api_java_client/1.0.0/api_java_client-1.0.0-javadoc.jar).

You can build your  Decision Optimization models in Java or you can use  Java worker to package CPLEX, CPO, and OPL models.

For more information about these models, see the following reference manuals.
