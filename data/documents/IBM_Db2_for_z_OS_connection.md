 IBM Db2 for z/OS connection 

To access your data in IBM Db2 for z/OS, create a connection asset for it.

Db2 for z/OS is an enterprise data server for IBM Z. It manages core business data across an enterprise and supports key business applications.

 Supported versions 

IBM Db2 for z/OS version 11 and later

 Prerequisites 

 Obtain the certificate file 

A certificate file on the Db2 for z/OS server is required to use this connection.These steps must be done on the Db2 for z/OS server: Obtain an IBM Db2 Connect Unlimited Edition license certificate file from [IBM Db2 Connect: Pricing](https://www.ibm.com/products/db2-connect/pricing) and [Installing the IBM Data Server Driver for JDBC and SQLJ](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.5?topic=apis-installing-data-server-driver-jdbc-sqlj). For installation instructions, see [Activating the license certificate file for Db2 Connect Unlimited Edition](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.5?topic=li-activating-license-certificate-file-db2-connect-unlimited-edition).

 Run the bind command 

Run the following commands from the Db2 client that is configured to access the Db2 for z/OS server.
You need to run the bind command only once per remote database per Db2 client version.

db2 connect to DBALIAS user USERID using PASSWORD
db2 bind path@ddcsmvs.lst blocking all sqlerror continue messages ddcsmvs.msg grant public
db2 connect reset

For information about bind commands, see [Binding applications and utilities (Db2 Connect Server)](https://www.ibm.com/docs/SSEPGG_11.5.0/com.ibm.db2.luw.qb.dbconn.doc/doc/c0005595.html?pos=2).

 Run catalog commands 

Run the following catalog commands from the Db2 client that is configured to access the Db2 for z/OS server:



1.      db2 catalog tcpip node node_name remote hostname_or_address server port_no_or_service_name

Example:
db2 catalog tcpip node db2z123 remote 192.0.2.0 server 446

2.      db2 catalog dcs database local_name as real_db_name

Example:
db2 catalog dcs database db2z123 as db2z123

3.      db2 catalog database local_name as alias at node node_name authentication server

Example:
db2 catalog database db2z123 as db2z123 at node db2z123 authentication server



For information about catalog commands, see [CATALOG TCPIP NODE](https://www.ibm.com/docs/SSEPGG_11.5.0/com.ibm.db2.luw.admin.cmd.doc/doc/r0001944.html) and [CATALOG DCS DATABASE](https://www.ibm.com/docs/SSEPGG_11.5.0/com.ibm.db2.luw.admin.cmd.doc/doc/r0001937.html).

 Create a connection to Db2 for z/OS 

To create the connection asset, you need these connection details:



*  Hostname or IP address
*  Port number
*  Collection ID: The ID of the collections of packages to use
*  Location: The unique name of the Db2 location you want to access
*  Username and password
*  Application name (optional): The name of the application that is currently using the connection. For information, see [Client info properties support by the IBM Data Server Driver for JDBC and SQLJ](https://www.ibm.com/docs/SSEPGG_11.5.0/Javadocs/src/tpc/imjcc_r0052001.html).
*  Client accounting information (optional): The value of the accounting string from the client information that is specified for the connection. For information, see [Client info properties support by the IBM Data Server Driver for JDBC and SQLJ](https://www.ibm.com/docs/SSEPGG_11.5.0/Javadocs/src/tpc/imjcc_r0052001.html).
*  Client hostname (optional): The hostname of the machine on which the application that is using the connection is running. For information, see [Client info properties support by the IBM Data Server Driver for JDBC and SQLJ](https://www.ibm.com/docs/SSEPGG_11.5.0/Javadocs/src/tpc/imjcc_r0052001.html).
*  Client user (optional): The name of the user on whose behalf the application that is using the connection is running. For information, see [Client info properties support by the IBM Data Server Driver for JDBC and SQLJ](https://www.ibm.com/docs/SSEPGG_11.5.0/Javadocs/src/tpc/imjcc_r0052001.html).
*  SSL certificate (if required by the database server)



For Private connectivity, to connect to a database that is not externalized to the internet (for example, behind a firewall), you must set up a [secure connection](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/manage-data/securingconn.html).

 Choose the method for creating a connection based on where you are in the platform 

In a project : Click Assets > New asset > Connect to a data source. See [Adding a connection to a project](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/manage-data/create-conn.html).

In a deployment space : Click Add to space > Connection. See [Adding connections to a deployment space](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/ml-space-add-assets.html).

In the Platform assets catalog : Click New connection. See [Adding platform connections](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/manage-data/platform-conn.html).

 Next step: Add data assets from the connection 



*  See [Add data from a connection in a project](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/manage-data/connected-data.html).



 Where you can use this connection 

You can use Db2 for z/OS connections in the following workspaces and tools:

Projects



*  Notebooks. Click Read data on the Code snippets pane to get the connection credentials and load the data into a data structure. See [Load data from data source connections](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/load-and-access-data.htmlconns).
*  Decision Optimization
*  SPSS Modeler
*  Synthetic Data Generator



Catalogs



*  Platform assets catalog



 Restriction 

For SPSS Modeler, you can use this connection only to import data. You cannot export data to this connection or to a Db2 for z/OS connected data asset.

 Running SQL statements 

To ensure that your SQL statements run correctly, refer to the [ Db2 for z/OS and SQL concepts](https://www.ibm.com/docs/db2-for-zos/12?topic=zos-db2-sql-concepts) for the correct syntax.
