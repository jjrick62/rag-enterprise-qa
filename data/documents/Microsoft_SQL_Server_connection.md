 Microsoft SQL Server connection 

You can create a connection asset for Microsoft SQL Server.

Microsoft SQL Server is a relational database management system.

 Supported versions 



*  Microsoft SQL Server 2000+
*  Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Desktop Engine (MSDE 2000)
*  Microsoft SQL Server 7.0



 Create a connection to Microsoft SQL Server 

To create the connection asset, you need the following connection details:



*  Database name
*  Hostname or IP address
*  Either the Port number or the Instance name. If the server is configured for dynamic ports, use the Instance name.
*  Username and password
*  Select Use Active Directory if the Microsoft SQL Server has been set up in a domain that uses NTLM (New Technology LAN Manager) authentication. Then enter the name of the domain that is associated with the username and password
*  SSL certificate (if required by the database server)



For Private connectivity, to connect to a database that is not externalized to the internet (for example, behind a firewall), you must set up a [secure connection](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/manage-data/securingconn.html).

 Choose the method for creating a connection based on where you are in the platform 

In a project : Click Assets > New asset > Connect to a data source. See [Adding a connection to a project](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/manage-data/create-conn.html).

In a deployment space : Click Add to space > Connection. See [Adding connections to a deployment space](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/ml-space-add-assets.html).

In the Platform assets catalog : Click New connection.

 Next step: Add data assets from the connection 



*  See [Add data from a connection in a project](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/manage-data/connected-data.html).



 Where you can use this connection 

You can use Microsoft SQL Server connections in the following workspaces and tools:

Projects



*  Data Refinery
*  Decision Optimization
*  Notebooks. Click Read data on the Code snippets pane to get the connection credentials and load the data into a data structure. See [Load data from data source connections](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/load-and-access-data.htmlconns).
*  SPSS Modeler
*  Synthetic Data Generator
