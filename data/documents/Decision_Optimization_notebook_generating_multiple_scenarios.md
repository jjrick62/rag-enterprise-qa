 Generating multiple scenarios 

This tutorial shows you how to generate multiple scenarios from a  notebook using randomized data. Generating multiple scenarios lets you test a model by exposing it to a wide range of data.

 Procedure 

To create and solve a scenario using a sample:



1.  Download and extract all the [DO-samples](https://github.com/IBMDecisionOptimization/DO-Samples) on to your machine. You can also download just the  StaffPlanning.zip file from the  Model_Builder subfolder for your product and version, but in this case do not extract it.
2.  Open your project or create an empty project.
3.  On the  Manage tab of your project, select the  Services and integrations section and click  Associate service. Then select an existing  Machine Learning service instance (or create a new one ) and click  Associate. When the service is associated, a success message is displayed, and you can then close the  Associate service window.
4.  Select the    Assets tab.
5.  Select   New asset > Solve optimization problems in the   Work with models section.
6.  Click  Local file in the   Solve optimization problems window that opens.
7.  Browse to choose the  StaffPlanning.zip file in the Model_Builder folder.  Select the relevant product and version subfolder in your downloaded  DO-samples.
8.  If you haven't already associated a  Machine Learning service with your project, you must first select  Add a  Machine Learning service to select or create one before you choose a deployment space for your  experiment.
9.  Click Create.A  Decision Optimization model is created with the same name as the sample.
10. Working in Scenario 1 of the StaffPlanning model, you can see that the solution contains tables to identify which resources work which days to meet expected demand. If there is no solution displayed, or to rerun the model, click Build model in the sidebar, then click Run to solve the model.
