 Geospatial data analysis 

You can use the geospatio-temporal library to expand your data science analysis in Python notebooks to include location analytics by gathering, manipulating and displaying imagery, GPS, satellite photography and historical data.

The gespatio-temporal library is available in all IBM Watson Studio Spark with Python runtime environments.

 Key functions 

The geospatio-temporal library includes functions to read and write data, topological functions, geohashing, indexing, ellipsoidal and routing functions.

Key aspects of the library include:



*  All calculated geometries are accurate without the need for projections.
*  The geospatial functions take advantage of the distributed processing capabilities provided by Spark.
*  The library includes native geohashing support for geometries used in simple aggregations and in indexing, thereby improving storage retrieval considerably.
*  The library supports extensions of Spark distributed joins.
*  The library supports the SQL/MM extensions to Spark SQL.



 Getting started with the library 

Before you can start using the library in a notebook, you must register STContext in your notebook to access the st functions.

To register STContext:

from pyst import STContext
stc = STContext(spark.sparkContext._gateway)

 Next steps 

After you have registered STContext in your notebook, you can begin exploring the spatio-temporal library for:



*  Functions to read and write data
*  Topological functions
*  Geohashing functions
*  Geospatial indexing functions
*  Ellipsoidal functions
*  Routing functions
